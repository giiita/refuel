Scaladia is a lightweight DI container.<br/>
Inspired by [Macwire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire)<br/>
I do not use macro.

## [scaladia-container-core](https://github.com/giiita/scaladia/tree/release/v1.6.3/scaladia-container-core)

> Lightweight DI container.<br/>
> Just by Mixining a specific trait, it will be loaded automatically into DIContainer.<br/>
> It is also possible to easily change dependencies from test cases or allow access only from arbitrary scopes.<br/>


## [scaladia-http](https://github.com/giiita/scaladia/tree/release/v1.6.3/scaladia-http)

> Http server call client.<br/>
> HTTP communication Client based on IO monad.<br/>
> In future, we plan to implement test stub control by DI and finatra interceptor..<br/>
