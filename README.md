Scaladia is not bothersome and is lightweight Scala Dependency Injection library<br/>
Inspired by [Macwire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire)<br/>

## [scaladia-container-core](https://github.com/giiita/scaladia/tree/master/scaladia-container)

> DI container core.<br/>
> Just by Mixining a specific trait, it will be loaded automatically into DIContainer.<br/>
> It is also possible to easily change dependencies from test cases or allow access only from arbitrary scopes.<br/>


## [scaladia-http](https://github.com/giiita/scaladia/tree/master/scaladia-http)

> Http server client with Akka-HTTP.<br/>
> In future, we plan to implement test stub control by dependency injection..<br/>
